<h1>Software Development</h1>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<h4>General Info</h4>
<p>Bugs should contain a bit of information so we or someone else can resolve it properly.<br>If you would like to report a bug with one of our projects, please ensure you choose the right one.<br>This means if you had an issue with our Database API, Website or Scanning API please use the appropriate GitHub to report the issue.<br>This is because we use different Programming languages and systems of handling issues internally once they are reported depending on programming language.</p>
<h4>Format of Bug Reports:</h4>
<p>Bug Reports have a certain format we would like to have them follow. This is to keep them consistent. We are currently also working on upholding that format, if we break it let us know to give us a slap on the wrist!</p>
<p>The format is:</p>
<ul class="todo-list">
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">Bug: A short description of the bug that you encountered (1-2 Sentences)</span></label></li>
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">Detail: A detailed description of the bug that you encountered (1 or more Paragraphs)</span></label></li>
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">Environment: Which Operating System and Programming / Runtime Environment you're using (For the Website this means which Web Browser)</span></label></li>
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">Optional: Images and Other information that could be related / helpful to solve the problem</span></label></li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<h4>General Info</h4>
<p>If you believe you found something that could be done / handled in a better way or think you might have a feature / library that interests us we would like to listen.<br>Improvements should be held relatively short and should just talk about how the improvement might make our project better</p>
<h4>Format of Improvement Reports</h4>
<p>Same as Bug reports, improvements also have a certain format we want them to follow.</p>
<p>The format is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improvement: A short description of the improvement you think you have (1-2 Sentences)</li>
  <li>Implementation Details: How you'd like to see the improvement implemented into our existing software stack</li>
  <li>Optional: Libraries or other things that may make this improvement possible / easier to do</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<h4>General Info</h4>
<p>If you believe you found some way to improve our documentation, or have trouble understanding a piece of code or documentation this is what you want to create!</p>
<h4>Format of Documentation Reports</h4>
<p>Like everything else, we also want documentation reports to follow a certain format</p>
<p>The format is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documentation Issue: A short sumup on what you are having trouble understanding (line of code or documentation link and line)</li>
  <li>Improvement Details: How you'd improve the documentation into something more readable (if possible)</li>
  <li>Optional: Additional help pages that might help us improve the documentation or fix errors with it</li>
</ul>
