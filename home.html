<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to our Wiki, which documents some of the ways our API works. We are thrilled to have you here. This website demonstrates how our services work, how you can contribute to them, and how you can set up your instances of our software.<br><br>As you might have not quite grasped what our project is about, we want to give a concise rundown of what we do as a company. Our goal is to create a service for detecting malicious media online. Our detection systems will include Images, Videos, and Executables. We follow a vision that security can’t be achieved through closed-source solutions and that we should all work together to build a better Internet for everyone. We are open to working with anyone who wants to and welcome developers who want to help with open arms.</p>
<h3>Who we even are</h3>
<p>Now you might ask yourself: who are you and why are you and what is your goals?<br>Pamaxie is a project created by a few people enthusiastic about online safety funded by the amazing people of the Prototypefund team. We are very happy we were given an opportunity to develop a prototype of our service which aims to provide detection of potentially harmful content. For the prototype we plan to only implement an image detection system. In the future however, depending on how well the prototype works, we plan on expanding this to videos, contextual text message (text in context) and even certain malicious files (aka Viruses).<br>This means depending on how well our project goes, we plan to expand quite a bit, offering privacy centric content protection systems, available for anyone.<br><br>The next part which differentiates us from other services is this: We offer free models for any non commercial projects. This means as long as you do not profit off your project and use our service (within reason), you can use it completely for free. This includes 1000 images per DAY for the beginning. We might have to adjust this, depending on how much load we can handle.<br><br>We hope this could give you a bit of a view into what we do. Please let us know if we can improve this introduction in any way.</p>
