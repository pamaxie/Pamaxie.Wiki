<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Data Protection</h2>
<p>Oversight of Data Security is handled by Pamaxie respective Data Protection Officers. Should you wish to make modifications, deletions, or additions to any personal data you believe to be captured by Pamaxie, or if you have any general security concerns, please contact support with the information on resolving your case <a href="mailto: &amp;#100;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#112;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#064;&amp;#112;&amp;#097;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#120;&amp;#105;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;">via email</a>.</p>
<h2>Information Collection on Websites</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, Pamaxie collects basic non-personally-identifying information from Website visitors of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, &nbsp;and the date and time of each visitor request. &nbsp;From time to time, Pamaxie may publicly release non-personally-identifying information collected from Website visitors in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website. Pamaxie also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from visitors. Pamaxie does not use such information to identify or track individual visitors, however. We collect this information to understand how visitors use our Websites, to improve their performance and content, and to monitor their security Pamaxie&nbsp;may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our Websites. For instance, Pamaxie&nbsp;may reveal how many downloads a particular version got using aggregated statistics that contain anonymous user information only.</p>
<h2>Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Users of the Websites or Software may choose to interact with Pamaxie&nbsp;in ways that provide us with their personally-identifying information. In some instances, a User ID is generated for form and URL tracking, page views, page pings, and usage counts in order to ascertain product performance and development. The amount and type of information that Pamaxie&nbsp;gathers depends on the nature of your interaction with us, as well as the amount of information you choose to share. For example, we ask visitors who use our Software to provide a username and email address to identify them on the Website. We will also collect the information you provide with us in connection with creating an account on the Website. If you report a security vulnerability to Pamaxie&nbsp;and request public acknowledgment, then we may publicly disclose the personal information you provided to us in connection with the report, including your name to fulfill your request for acknowledgment. In each case, our Software collects such personally identifiable information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s interaction with or request of our Software. We will not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in this Privacy Policy. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain Website or Software related activities or being able to access and use certain features and services.</p>
<h2>Information we do not collect</h2>
<p>Pamaxie does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Pamaxie&nbsp;does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that users might store this kind of information on their Profile in Games or other Software. If you store any sensitive personal information on Pamaxie&nbsp;servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, which are located in Germany. If you're a child under the age of 14, you may not have an account on the Website. Pamaxie&nbsp;does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our Website or content specifically to children under 14. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 14, we will close the child’s account. Other countries may have different minimum age limits. If you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use Pamaxie.</p>
<h2>Responsibility of Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Pamaxie&nbsp;has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to the Website, and cannot, therefore, be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects. By operating the Website, Pamaxie&nbsp;does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful, or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Website may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Website may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying, or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. Pamaxie disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Website, or from any downloading by those visitors of content there posted. You are encouraged to report any violations of our Acceptable Use requirements to Pamaxie&nbsp;Management and customer care.</p>

Legitimate interests.
