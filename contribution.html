<h1>Basics</h1>
<p>Before starting to get everything setup, please read our contribution guidelines which can be found <a href="https://github.com/pamaxie/Pamaxie/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md">here</a>. You may also wanna read our <a href="https://github.com/pamaxie/Pamaxie/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">code of conduct</a> and make sure you follow it at all times. These to have to be followed as closely as possible, breaking the code of conduct will forbid you from usage of our API and you will be blocked from interacting with our repository or services.</p>
<h2>Recommended way of interacting with our Repositories</h2>
<p>For managing our repositories, we recommend you to use a fork and ask to merge your fork back into our project.<br>You can create a fork very easily by going to the desired project on our GitHub and pressing “fork”. More information on forking and merging a fork with the main project can be found <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks">here</a><br><br>For managing check-ins, branches and the general repository we would recommend you to use <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a> (this is what the majority of our team uses for working with GitHub).<br>For instructions on how to setup GitKraken in combination with GitHub <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/integrations/github#:~:text=Simply%20navigate%20to%20the%20upper,the%20Connect%20to%20GitHub%20button.">please look here</a>.&nbsp;<br>This will give you a basic setup on how to link your GitHub account with GitKraken and get started with your just forked version of Pamaxie.<br>After that you want to get the initial version of Pamaxie and look if there is any issues that need to be worked on.&nbsp;<br>The issues for our main project can be found <a href="https://github.com/pamaxie/Pamaxie/issues">here</a>. For all other repositories, please check the individual “issue” tab on the top.&nbsp;<br>Please DO NOT do work without an issue, you can create an issue or ask for one to be added to our GitHub page.&nbsp;<br>he issue is that our current project manager needs to consider all issues and distribute them among different people.&nbsp;<br>Please also see if an issue has been assigned to someone before starting to work on it. If you want to work on a ticket please write “joink” into the issues comments. &nbsp;<br>We will assign it to you once we see it.</p>
<h2>Re-Merging your fork with the Main Repo</h2>
<p>Once you fixed your problem you can re-merge your fork into the main repository. Please make sure that you follow our coding standards.&nbsp;<br>For C# they can be found <a href="/en/CodeStyleGuide/cs-code_styleguide">here</a>. Everything else can be found under the “Code Style guide” tab on the left.<br>We then will review your code first via our Actions, then Manually, making sure that it follows our style guides and that there is no bugs / apparent issues that we can see with the code you checked in.<br>Please ALWAYS check your code for any apparent bugs before checking it in, this saves us a lot of work.<br><br><strong>This is it for now! Its this easy. We will add more information on testing the API / Server Side of things in here in the future.</strong></p>
