<h1>A Fair Warning</h1>
<p>We generally advise against setting up your own servers, but it is a possibility if your current scenario requires a different kind of scale we can offer.<br>You can always contact us, however certain levels of support maybe charged for especially for self hosting since it is not really covered by our project per se.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Database</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>The requirements for hosting our API without modification are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://redis.com/">A Redis Server</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">A Postgres Server</a></li>
  <li>A <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a> API Token (<a href="https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys">tutorial on how to create one</a>)</li>
  <li>A Docker or Kubernetes Server (<a href="https://wiki.pamaxie.com/en/self-hosting/kuberenetes-scripts">for the Kubernetes example scripts with explanations please see here</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>After all these requirements are met, you require our current Database API as a docker container. <a href="https://wiki.pamaxie.com/en/self-hosting/enviorement-variables">This Docker container should have a few environment variables set</a>.<br>Let's go into detail for some of them, for the Db1 and Db2 Settings you require a connection string. The connection string looks like this:</p>
<p>Db1 Settings: <code>Host=localhost;Username=postgres;Password=postgresPass;Database=pamaxie;</code></p>
<p>The Db1 Settings are loaded via EntityFramework's db context. <a href="https://www.npgsql.org/doc/connection-string-parameters.html">The parameters for a Pg-SQL connection </a>string can be set individually, separated by a ‘;’ character. After each parameter you put in a ‘=’ character.</p>
<p>Db2 Settings: <code>redis0:6380,redis1:6380,allowAdmin=true,password=redisPass</code></p>
<p>The Db2 Settings are loaded via the StackExchange.Redis implementation. <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/Configuration.html">The parameters for a Redis connection</a> string can be set individually, separated by a ‘;’ character. After each parameter you put a ‘=’ character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JwtTimeout and JwtLLTimeout should both be integers, where for the normal timeout it specifies in minutes how long the timeout is. For the long lived timeout it specifies the timeout in days.<br>This means if I set the JwtTimeout to 30 it will make the normal JWT bearer tokens expire after 30 <strong><u>MINUTES</u></strong> if we set the JwtLLTimeout to 30 it will make the long lived JWT bearer tokens expire after 30 <strong><u>DAYS</u></strong>.</p>
<p>The JWT secret should be longer than 32 characters and be randomly generated and stored securely and NEVER shared with ANYONE.</p>
<h2>Setting everything up</h2>
<p><a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pamaxie/database">You can pull our Docker image</a>, and then you should start it with the appropriate environment variables. We will warn you if you missed any of the required ones.</p>
<p>An example of a startup command for a docker container with all environment variables filled would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">docker run&nbsp;
-e Db1Settings="Host=localhost;Username=postgres;Password=postgresPass;Database=pamaxie;" \
-e Db2Settings="redis0:6380,redis1:6380,allowAdmin=true,password=redisPass" \
-e JwtSecret="YourSecret" \
-e SendGridToken="YourToken" \
-e EndpointUrl="http://localhost/db/v1/" \
-e Hosts="http://0.0.0.0:8080" \
pamaxie/database:latest</code></pre>
<p>If you're planning with a larger scale deployment we advise using <a href="https://wiki.pamaxie.com/en/self-hosting/kuberenetes-scripts">our Kubernetes scripts</a> to automatically deploy your servers. This is to ensure the configuration can be changed more easily and targeting individual releases is easier.</p>
<p>After running the script your server should be available and accepting connections, if this didn't work, feel free to contact us <a href="https://discord.gg/WsJnPTcvae">via our discord server</a>.</p>
<h1>Scanning</h1>
<p>The Scanning API is still being build and not available for release or testing yet.</p>
