<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to Pamaxies Wiki. This will be used for all projects that Pamaxie offers and create a consise documentation about working with our libraries. Implementing your own Libraries. Setting up Servers to use our software or just wanting to contribute to our source code. If there is any information that is not covered here, please feel free to create a ticket with the “documentation” tag on our GitHub repository where you have issues with the coverage of documentation.</p>
<p>The rest of this page will explain basic information about which Network Infastructure we use for hosting Pamaxie (to inspire you to build one off it). We will also create a short guide on what is to be considered before contributing to pamaxie,&nbsp;<br>since it can be a very complex project to work on.</p>
<h1>Network Infastructure</h1>
<p>We are currently finishing up conceptionalization on the Network Infastrucutre on how we want Pamaxies network to look in production as well. This means <strong>this segement will be completed once we have finished thinking about an optimal way to have a easily scalable, jet non excessive network setup</strong>. Since this project is currently entirely funded by donations we need to keep cost VERY low.</p>
<h1>Contribute to Pamaxie</h1>
<p>Before contributing your source code, please make sure that you know and understand our code styles.&nbsp;<br>All languages that we end up using with Pamaxies development will have a specific structure we require developers to comply to.&nbsp;<br>This is especially important to keep code readable. These guides can be found under the “Code Style / Design Guides” grouping.</p>
<h2>Setting up development enviorement</h2>
<p>We generally recommend using <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a> to manage our Git Repositories. Since all projects with Pamaxie are hosted publically accessable, all you need is the free version of it.&nbsp;<br>Other software to manage GitHub repositories include <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> or the &nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git CLI</a> <strong>[COMPLEX]</strong>. You may also use JetBrains integrated solutions (some people in our team prefer this).</p>
<p>For our Development we use <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio</a>. Some of our Devs also replaced Visual Studio with Jetbrains products (<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Rider</a> for C#, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a> for C &amp; C++, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> for Python, etc..).&nbsp;<br>For Interpreter Languages like Python and JS some of us also use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">VS Code</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Visual Studio Plugins</h2>
<p>We have a number of plugins we recommend for Visual Studio Development.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/model-builder">ML.NET Model Builder</a> (This is a simple UI tool to build custom machine learning models in VS2019)</li>
  <li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.FileNesting">File Nesting</a> (Automatically nests files based on file name and enables developers to nest / unnest any file manually)</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>C# Specific Plugins</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">JetBrains ReSharper</a> (Productivity Extension for VS2019)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>IntelliJ / Jetbrains IDE Plugins</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12804-discordbeam">DiscordBeam</a> (Share files and code to a Discord Server, we use this for our Internal Discord Server a lot)</li>

</ul>
<h1>About Pamaxie</h1>
<p>Pamaxie is a publicly accessible content filter aimed at software and hardware developers. Utilizing it, they can determine what type of data was sent through their system and if it is safe for their end users.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Problems we are tackling</h2>
<p>We plan on developing on an open source, self-hostable API that allows its users to scan media send to it. We plan on detecting malicious files, hate speech, false information and adult content through it. This should hopefully make it easier for website and application developers to focus on their main business instead of developing their own content detection systems. We hope this saves developer time, effort and money implementing systems of the same scale as ours.</p>
<h2>How we plan to solve them</h2>
<p>We plan on solving the problems through open research in the various fields required, working together with other specialists to find a solution to our problems.&nbsp;<br>For image detection and filtering we decided on using machine learning implementations to detect various tags for images. This includes for example Nazi symbolism and nudity. After that we deliver the results with the media type we detected. Media type detection is done through magic numbers, a few bytes at the start of the file’s binary data. This is a method to detect the media type based on the binary data of a format. This works because many formats start their data with a number of bytes to identify it.&nbsp;<br><br>We are implementing Video detection, which is going to be supported in the future. It is using a combination of iFrame extraction and frame deltas to get keyframes from videos via FFMPEG. After this is completed, the extracted frames are ran through a neural network. Then, like the other solutions we return the media type and detected labels for the data. What is slightly different with Video detection is that we also deliver the rough timestamps which contained certain labels (for example Nazi symbolism).&nbsp;<br><br>Identification of different types of known exploits is also planned, but the implementation is still being discussed. This would include detecting known viruses or exploits like zip bombs or ransomware. We are probably only going to work over a database of banned software hashes to keep the solution maintainable for us. We are also looking into solutions involving AV software. This solution will not be developed on for a while.&nbsp;<br><br>Text classification is also planned to allow identification of hate speech or the spreading of wrong information online. This solution is still being discussed and also probably not going to be worked on for a while. Its implementation would work based on natural language processing. We will also host an instance of the API making it even more accessible for smaller companies/projects who don’t have the resources to host it themselves. This will work over a registration of an account and an application on our website. This website will also serve as a central hub for companies, or us to manage the API controllers from.</p>
