<h1>Software Development</h1>
<h2>General Coding</h2>
<p>Please ensure you follow the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/">google code guidelines</a> to a close degree when you work / develop on our Project. This is just to ensure we have a consistent and readable code base. To a close degree means small deviations (for convenience) are ok, but we prefer a more written out code style to ensure everything is easily readable for everyone. This means language shortcuts and other things maybe held to a minimum if beginners of said language struggle with them.<br><br>We also would like, if you have some cool tooling we could use, if you'd let us know. We are always looking into new tooling to make documentation processes easier and if you'd like to improve our way of contributing to the project you are always welcome to give us feedback. Our community is build to listen to everyone no matter how young or experienced they are.</p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<h4>General Info</h4>
<p>Bugs should contain a bit of information so we or someone else can resolve it properly.<br>If you would like to report a bug with one of our projects, please ensure you choose the right one.<br>This means if you had an issue with our Database API, Website or Scanning API please use the appropriate GitHub to report the issue.<br>This is because we use different Programming languages and systems of handling issues internally once they are reported depending on programming language.</p>
<h4>Format of Bug Reports:</h4>
<p>Bug Reports have a certain format we would like to have them follow. This is to keep them consistent. We are currently also working on upholding that format, if we break it let us know to give us a slap on the wrist!</p>
<p>The format is:</p>
<ul class="todo-list">
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">Bug: A short description of the bug that you encountered (1-2 Sentences)</span></label></li>
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">Detail: A detailed description of the bug that you encountered (1 or more Paragraphs)</span></label></li>
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">Environment: Which Operating System and Programming / Runtime Environment you're using (For the Website this means which Web Browser)</span></label></li>
  <li><label class="todo-list__label"><input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"><span class="todo-list__label__description">Optional: Images and Other information that could be related / helpful to solve the problem</span></label></li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<h4>General Info</h4>
<p>If you believe you found something that could be done / handled in a better way or think you might have a feature / library that interests us we would like to listen.<br>Improvements should be held relatively short and should just talk about how the improvement might make our project better</p>
<h4>Format of Improvement Reports</h4>
<p>Same as Bug reports, improvements also have a certain format we want them to follow.</p>
<p>The format is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improvement: A short description of the improvement you think you have (1-2 Sentences)</li>
  <li>Implementation Details: How you'd like to see the improvement implemented into our existing software stack</li>
  <li>Optional: Libraries or other things that may make this improvement possible / easier to do</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<h4>General Info</h4>
<p>If you believe you found some way to improve our documentation, or have trouble understanding a piece of code or documentation this is what you want to create!</p>
<h4>Format of Documentation Reports</h4>
<p>Like everything else, we also want documentation reports to follow a certain format</p>
<p>The format is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documentation Issue: A short sumup on what you are having trouble understanding (line of code or documentation link and line)</li>
  <li>Improvement Details: How you'd improve the documentation into something more readable (if possible)</li>
  <li>Optional: Additional help pages that might help us improve the documentation or fix errors with it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pull Requests</h2>
<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>Pull requests should always tag an issue in their title that they are resolving. Please ensure a pull request only fixes one issue.&nbsp;<br>If you fix multiple issues please let us know in the description of the pull request.<br>The Description should also follow a format like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What issue did you resolve?</li>
  <li>How did you end up resolving it?</li>
  <li>Does this pull request fix any additional issues?</li>
  <li>Did you do Validations to Ensure you follow the Google Code Style Guidelines to a reasonable degree?</li>
  <li>Did you ensure you follow Clean Code Guidelines (including: Separation of Concern and KISS)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Legal Help</h1>
<h2>Talking / Contacting us properly</h2>
<p>If you are a <u>lawyer</u> or qualified professional for giving legal advise and would like to give us legal advise, please feel free to join our discord server and ping us to let us know you found a legal issue / concern in one of our legal documents. Please know that if you are not a lawyer you won't get far as we will ask for qualifications, to ensure we don't get into any scams / problematic legal behavior.</p>
<p>This vetting will be done for all people and please do not be offended we do so. We are just aware there is a lot of wrong legal advise out there and want to shield us from it. We hope you understand. <strong>People who are impersonating a lawyer or qualified professional to give legal advise us will be blocked / banned from our discord and reported to their Team for impersonating a lawyer. We want to make this VERY clear.</strong></p>
<h1>Security Vulnerabilities</h1>
<h2>Proper consideration of publicity of concern</h2>
<p>Certain security vulnerabilities, if not fixed could produce public concern as in result in leaking of personal data, credit card information or give access to remote systems (arbitrary / remote code execution). We would like those security concerns to be handled with us privately. This can be done via Email, IRC or Discord. In our Discord Server ping us, <a href="mailto:&amp;#100;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#112;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#064;&amp;#112;&amp;#097;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#120;&amp;#105;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;">via email directly</a>, or you send us your Libera.â€‹Chat username and a passphrase <a href="mailto:&amp;#100;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#112;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#064;&amp;#112;&amp;#097;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#120;&amp;#105;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;">via email</a> (this is to ensure you know we are really who we are).&nbsp;<br>We will get back to you but it might take a while depending on the amount of emails we currently have to deal with. I hope you understand.</p>
<h2>How we handle security vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>Security vulnerabilities will always be made public, either before or after they are fixed. We do not believe in obscurification of security vulnerabilities and are working on a wiki page that can go live once the first vulnerability with our service is detected.<br>Our servers may also contain certain vulnerabilities, depending on operating system or other issues, those will be handled on a separate page to separate our Software from our backed problems, as to ensure people who self host can easily distinguish between the two.</p>
<h1>Artists</h1>
<h2>Before you help us</h2>
<p>Hey! You'd like to help us as an artist!! That's really lovely and we really really need you for our brand building and spreading our message. Before you start you should know we are a inclusive company and believe in equality and would like our artwork to represent that. Also we do not like a commercial, dry art style (the overdone art style that pretty much any company uses). So if you have some interesting ideas for art, ping us in our discord server or let us know in general. We are always interested to work together with artists.<br><br>Also please make sure to talk to us first, so we can find a right spot for your idea before you start with it!</p>
