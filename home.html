<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to our wiki, we're happy to have you here. We are using this site to document certain things about our API, Setting up Servers or giving examples on how to help contribute to Pamaxie. Pamaxie is build to follow the open source philosophy in a very very distinct manner. What this means is this:&nbsp;<br>This project is first off never intended to be developed by one person or company. We believe content filters should be developed with all kinds of cultures and people in mind and this is where you come in! You can contribute to our effort in many ways, even if you don't know how to code at all. We require people to go through content we collected on the internet and see if they find it offensive with a reason why they think it should be filtered. We also need translators to make sure everyone can read this wiki and knows how to setup or work with this project.</p>
<p>We also need people who are willing to contribute to our designs of our website, general service design (aka how we represent ourselves) and fix the odd typo here and there.<br>We think a community of people enthusiastic about ensuring online safety without risking anyone's privacy is very important.</p>
<p>As a community, enthusiastic about improving online safety we are far stronger than any company could ever be &lt;3</p>
<h3>Who we even are</h3>
<p>Now you might ask yourself: who are you and why are you and what is your goals?<br>Pamaxie is a project created by a few people enthusiastic about online safety funded by the amazing people of the Prototypefund team. We are very happy we were given an opportunity to develop a prototype of our service which aims to provide detection of potentially harmful content. For the prototype we plan to only implement an image detection system. In the future however, depending on how well the prototype works, we plan on expanding this to videos, contextual text message (text in context) and even certain malicious files (aka Viruses).<br>This means depending on how well our project goes, we plan to expand quite a bit, offering privacy centric content protection systems, available for anyone.<br><br>The next part which differentiates us from other services is this: We offer free models for any non commercial projects. This means as long as you do not profit off your project and use our service (within reason), you can use it completely for free. This includes 1000 images per DAY for the beginning. We might have to adjust this, depending on how much load we can handle.</p>
<p>Talking about handling loads, we also offer spinning up your own detection clients, which just require an API key and you can scan your own content. As much as you want. No rate limits, even if used commercially. This is all still in conceptualization and might change in the future (depending on how abused this is). But for now we plan on letting people spin up their own workers by running a python script. &nbsp;This requires only a smaller server, something along the lines of 2 CPU cores and 4 GB of ram. We also plan to implement GPU and TPU support (with TPU support being planned to work with the initial prototype).<br><br>We hope this could give you a bit of a view into what we do. Please let us know if we can improve this introduction in any way.</p>
<h3>Where to go from here</h3>
<p>If you're looking to help, or just want to get started integrating our API, we first recommend you join <a href="https://discord.gg/WsJnPTcvae">our Discord server</a>.&nbsp;<br>This way we can help find your way if you ever get lost.<br><br>Other than that you can navigate to the different pages about how to contribute or integrate or maybe even setup your own server on the right!<br>Good luck and we're happy to have you &lt;3</p>
