<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to Pamaxies Wiki. This will be used for all projects that Pamaxie offers and create a consise documentation about working with our libraries. Implementing your own Libraries. Setting up Servers to use our software or just wanting to contribute to our source code. If there is any information that is not covered here, please feel free to create a ticket with the “documentation” tag on our GitHub repository where you have issues with the coverage of documentation.</p>
<p>The rest of this page will explain basic information about which Network Infastructure we use for hosting Pamaxie (to inspire you to build one off it). We will also create a short guide on what is to be considered before contributing to pamaxie,&nbsp;<br>since it can be a very complex project to work on.</p>
<h1>Network Infastructure</h1>
<p>Pamaxies Network-Infastructure is still in the works, tho a basic concept has been made. We would recommend any designer to try to mimic this structure to ensure compability, however we will try out various different network setups once the software is publically available to ensure that users can easily set pamaxie up in their network concestellation without having to design a completely seperate one. First off our entire network structure was designed with redundancy in mind as well as a high level ob obscurification. This means that most services are usually INTENDED to run on their own systems and not all on one server (although possible). This is due to the scanning of images, tho optimized taking up a lot of resources once in progress. This means usually scanning an image or video will take up 100% of all available system resources for a short moment to ensure scanning doesn't take long. Even though we are currently not focusing on optimization we will try to optimize the scanning a lot in the future to ensure that it runs smoothly and quickly on lower end hardware as well.<br><br><strong>The detailed network infastructure has not been determined yet. Please come back later once its been decided on.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Contribute to Pamaxie</h1>
<p>Before contributing your source code, please make sure that you know and understand our code styles.&nbsp;<br>All languages that we end up using with Pamaxies development will have a specific structure we require developers to comply to.&nbsp;<br>This is especially important to keep code readable. These guides can be found under the “Code Style / Design Guides” grouping.</p>
<h2>Setting up development enviorement</h2>
<p>We generally recommend using <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a> to manage our Git Repositories. Since all projects with Pamaxie are hosted publically accessable, all you need is the free version of it.&nbsp;<br>Other software to manage GitHub repositories include <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> or the &nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git CLI</a> <strong>[COMPLEX]</strong>. You may also use JetBrains integrated solutions (some people in our team prefer this).</p>
<p>For our Development we use <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio</a>. Some of our Devs also replaced Visual Studio with Jetbrains products (<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Rider</a> for C#, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a> for C &amp; C++, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> for Python, etc..).&nbsp;<br>For Interpreter Languages like Python and JS some of us also use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">VS Code</a>.</p>
