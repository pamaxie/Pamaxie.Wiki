<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to Pamaxies Wiki. This will be used for all projects that Pamaxie offers and create a consise documentation about working with our libraries. Implementing your own Libraries. Setting up Servers to use our software or just wanting to contribute to our source code. If there is any information that is not covered here, please feel free to create a ticket with the “documentation” tag on our GitHub repository where you have issues with the coverage of documentation.</p>
<p>The rest of this page will explain basic information about which Network Infastructure we use for hosting Pamaxie (to inspire you to build one off it). We will also create a short guide on what is to be considered before contributing to pamaxie,&nbsp;<br>since it can be a very complex project to work on.</p>
<h1>Network Infastructure</h1>
<p>We are currently finishing up conceptionalization on the Network Infastrucutre on how we want Pamaxies network to look in production as well. This means <strong>this segement will be completed once we have finished thinking about an optimal way to have a easily scalable, jet non excessive network setup</strong>. Since this project is currently entirely funded by donations we need to keep cost VERY low.</p>
<h1>Contribute to Pamaxie</h1>
<p>Before contributing your source code, please make sure that you know and understand our code styles.&nbsp;<br>All languages that we end up using with Pamaxies development will have a specific structure we require developers to comply to.&nbsp;<br>This is especially important to keep code readable. These guides can be found under the “Code Style / Design Guides” grouping.</p>
<h2>Setting up development enviorement</h2>
<p>We generally recommend using <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a> to manage our Git Repositories. Since all projects with Pamaxie are hosted publically accessable, all you need is the free version of it.&nbsp;<br>Other software to manage GitHub repositories include <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> or the &nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git CLI</a> <strong>[COMPLEX]</strong>. You may also use JetBrains integrated solutions (some people in our team prefer this).</p>
<p>For our Development we use <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio</a>. Some of our Devs also replaced Visual Studio with Jetbrains products (<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Rider</a> for C#, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a> for C &amp; C++, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> for Python, etc..).&nbsp;<br>For Interpreter Languages like Python and JS some of us also use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">VS Code</a>.</p>
