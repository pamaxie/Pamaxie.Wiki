### About
### We have started development again. This is a long process and will take a while to get rolling. For now we will focus mostly on our web presence to drive more traffic to the project.
This is the source for the documentation [of pamaxies source code](https://wiki.pamaxie.com/). This means all content on the website will be saved on here as a backup and to enable changes / corrections by users.

### Contribution
Since we syncronize our wiki two way it means you can also change things on here and it will be updated on the wiki. We would just beg you not to make nonsensical changes. All changes will be validated for grammar / logic before they are commited onto our wiki.
We may also deny any changes without giving a reason, this may be due to a number of things like having no qualified people in a language to validate if the content of the language is reasonable.
