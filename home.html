<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to our Wiki, which documents some of the ways our API works. We are thrilled to have you here. This website demonstrates how our services work, how you can contribute to them, and how you can set up your instances of our software.<br><br>As you might have not quite grasped what our project is about, we want to give a concise rundown of what we do as a company. Our goal is to create a service for detecting malicious media online. Our detection systems will include Images, Videos, and Executables. We follow a vision that security can’t be achieved through closed-source solutions and that we should all work together to build a better Internet for everyone. We are open to working with anyone who wants to and welcome developers who want to help with open arms.</p>
<h3>Where to go from here</h3>
<p>If you're looking to help, or just want to get started integrating our API, we first recommend you join <a href="https://discord.gg/WsJnPTcvae">our Discord server</a>.&nbsp;<br>This way we can help find your way if you ever get lost.<br><br>Other than that you can navigate to the different pages about how to contribute or integrate or maybe even setup your own server on the right!<br>Good luck and we're happy to have you ❤️</p>
