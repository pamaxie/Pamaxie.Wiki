<h1>About</h1>
<p>Pamaxie Image Preperation is a tool we use internally for testing the reliability of our scans and sorting through data we may have collected with other tools that can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/pamaxie/Pamaxie.Tooling">Tooling Repository</a>.<br>This is also used to artifically increase data size and removing bias by rotating, color shifting and setting a fixed resolution for images.&nbsp;<br>This prevents certain biases the neural network may develop if we didn't employ this tactic.&nbsp;<br>All these tactics / tools have been tested extensively and work in improving the overal quality and making it easier to collect a basic dataset for us to train off of.</p>
<h1>Image Comparison</h1>
<p>This is what is used to scan image content. We mainly use this to test the reliability of our neural network. <strong>Additional help will be added later for this tool.</strong></p>
