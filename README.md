### About
### It is with a hard feeling in our heart, that we have to announce, that Pamaxie as a project is cancelled. Due to lacking funds and massive changes in the project owners life (Leejja) we currently no longer have the financial or time capacity to maintain it which is why we think it is best that we close this chapter of our life. We are sorry that we could not live up to our promises. We are looking into a cheap way to host our dataset. If possible we may update this page. Due to concerns for the public we might not however (there is some graphic imagry in there which may be quite disturbing or problematic to release)
This is the source for the documentation [of pamaxies source code](https://wiki.pamaxie.com/). This means all content on the website will be saved on here as a backup and to enable changes / corrections by users.

### Contribution
Since we syncronize our wiki two way it means you can also change things on here and it will be updated on the wiki. We would just beg you not to make nonsensical changes. All changes will be validated for grammar / logic before they are commited onto our wiki.
We may also deny any changes without giving a reason, this may be due to a number of things like having no qualified people in a language to validate if the content of the language is reasonable.
