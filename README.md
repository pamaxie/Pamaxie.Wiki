This is the source for the documentation [of pamaxies source code](https://wiki.pamaxie.com/). This means all content on the website will be saved on here as a backup as well.

### About
This project basically contains all changes to all files that were made on Pamaxies wiki since its release. This is important to be able to rollback changes if we detect issues with changes we made ourselfs. 

### Contribution
Since we syncronize our wiki two way it means you can also change things on here and it will be updated on the wiki. We would just beg you not to make nonsensical changes. All changes will be validated for grammar / logic before they are commited onto our wiki.
We may also deny any changes without giving a reason, this may be due to a number of things like having no qualified people in a language to validate if the content of the language is reasonable.
