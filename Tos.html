<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last revised on: <code>13. April at 3:50 UTC+1</code></p>
<h2>The Gist</h2>
<p>Pamaxie operates the Pamaxie service, which we hope you use. If you use it, please use it responsibly. If you don't, we'll have to terminate your account.</p>
<p>For paid accounts, you'll be charged on a monthly basis. You can cancel anytime, but there are no refunds.</p>
<p>You own the source code that you provide to Pamaxie and you're responsible for keeping it safe.</p>
<p>The Terms of Service, Pamaxie itself, and our prices can change at any time. We'll warn you 30 days in advance of any price changes. We'll try to warn you about major changes to the Terms of Service or Pamaxie, but we make no guarantees.</p>
<p>That's the basic idea, but You must read through the entire Terms of Service below and agree with all the details before You use any of our sites (whether or not you have created an account).</p>
