<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>Before starting to get everything setup, please read our contribution guidelines which can be found <a href="https://github.com/pamaxie/Pamaxie/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md">here</a>. You may also wanna read our <a href="https://github.com/pamaxie/Pamaxie/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">code of conduct</a>.<br>These to have to be followed as closely as possible, breaking the code of conduct will void and usage of our API as well as get you banned from our repositories.</p>
<h2>Recommended Repo Managment and finding an issue</h2>
<p>For managing our repositories, we recommend you to use a fork and ask to merge your fork back into our project.<br>You can create a fork very easily by going to the desired project on our github and pressing “fork”. More information on forking and merging a fork with the main project can be found <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks">here</a>.<br><br>For managing Checkins, branches and the general repository we would recommend you to use <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a> (this is what the majority of our team uses for working with Github).<br>For instructions on how to setup GitKraken <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/integrations/github#:~:text=Simply%20navigate%20to%20the%20upper,the%20Connect%20to%20GitHub%20button.">please look here</a>.&nbsp;<br>This will give you a basic setup on how to link your GitHub account with GitKraken and get started with your just forked version of Pamaxie.<br>After that you want to get the initial version of Pamaxie and look if there is any issues that need to be worked on.&nbsp;<br>The issues for our main project can be found <a href="https://github.com/pamaxie/Pamaxie/issues">here</a>. For all other repositories, please check the individual “issue” tab on the top.&nbsp;<br>Please DO NOT do work without an issue, you can create an issue or ask for one to be added to our Github page.&nbsp;<br>he issue is that our current project manager needs to consider all issues and distribute them among different people.&nbsp;<br>Please also see if an issue has been joinked by someone. If you want to joink a ticket please write “joink” into the ticket. &nbsp;We will assign it to you once we see it.</p>
<h2>Re-Merging your fork with the Main Repo</h2>
<p>Once you fixed your problem you can re-merge your fork into the main repository. Please make sure that you follow our coding standards.&nbsp;<br>For C# they can be found <a href="/en/CodeStyleGuide/cs-code_styleguide">here</a>. Everything else can be found under the “Code Styleguide” tab on the left.<br>We then will review your code first via our Actions, then Manually, making sure that it follows our Styleguides and that there is no bugs / appearent issues that we can see with the code you checked in.<br>Please ALWAYS check your code for any appearent bugs before checking it in, this saves us a lot of work.<br><br><strong>This is it for now! Its this easy. We will add more information on testing the API / Server Side of things in here in the future.</strong></p>
