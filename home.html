<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to Pamaxies Wiki.&nbsp;<br>We are still in the process of getting everything setup and running software as well as hardware wise.&nbsp;<br>We are also designing our structures to ensure a easy setup in the end for any user. This is why we don't recommend self hosting pamaxie as of yet and don't offer any tutorials on it. Once they are available we will link them here, they will also be available by clicking <a href="https://wiki.pamaxie.com/en/server-setup/website-setup">here.</a></p>
<p>The rest of this Home-Page will be dedicated to explaining Pamaxies functionality in detail as well as all the different modules that are found on <a href="https://github.com/pamaxie/Pamaxie">our main gitub repository</a>.</p>
<h1>Network Infastructure</h1>
<p>Pamaxies Network-Infastructure is still in the works, tho a basic concept has been made. We would recommend any designer to try to mimic this structure to ensure compability, however we will try out various different network setups once the software is publically available to ensure that users can easily set pamaxie up in their network concestellation without having to design a completely seperate one. First off our entire network structure was designed with redundancy in mind as well as a high level ob obscurification. This means that most services are usually INTENDED to run on their own systems and not all on one server (although possible). This is due to the scanning of images, tho optimized taking up a lot of resources once in progress. This means usually scanning an image or video will take up 100% of all available system resources for a short moment to ensure scanning doesn't take long. Even though we are currently not focusing on optimization we will try to optimize the scanning a lot in the future to ensure that it runs smoothly and quickly on lower end hardware as well.<br><br><strong>The detailed network infastructure has not been determined yet. Please come back later once its been decided on.</strong></p>
